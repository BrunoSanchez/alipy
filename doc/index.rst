About
-----

This is a python package to quickly, automatically, and robustly identify geometrical transforms between optical astronomical images, using only field stars. The images can have different pixel sizes, orientations, pointings and filters.

.. note:: alipy is personal code, and work in progress... It might be useful (it is for me, I hope it will be for you), but don't expect too much !


Summary of typical workflow :
 * We run SExtractor (see :doc:`installation`) on the images to get individual source catalogs.
 * We identify corresponding asterisms, roughly following `Lang et al. (2010) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AJ....139.1782L>`_ aka `astrometry.net <http://www.astrometry.net>`_.
 * We use this identification to match catalogs, align the images (either directly with scipy, or pyraf geomap/gregister), ...
